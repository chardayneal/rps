# rps-theOdinProject

This project is a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

When the first round begins, the player is given a chance to select rock, paper or scissors. If an invalid selection is entered, the player is alerted, the computer's choice is selected and no one is given a point. If selection is valid, then the computer's choice is selected at random.

After each round, the score of the winner is updated with one point. 

After five rounds, the game is concluded and prints the player with the most points.
